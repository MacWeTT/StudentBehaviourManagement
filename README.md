# Student Behaviour Management

This repository documents the major project completed during my final year of B.Tech, developed as part of a 12-month internship at **Toddle**. The project focuses on building a comprehensive module for tracking and managing student behaviour in schools.

## 🔍 Project Overview

The **Student Behaviour Management** module empowers schools to systematically log, monitor, and act upon student behaviour — positive, neutral, or negative. It centralizes behavioural data, enabling collaborative action and informed decision-making.

### Key Features

- **Centralized Reporting System**: Log behavioural incidents in real-time.
- **Collaborative Handling**: Tag other staff/students for multi-party input.
- **Referral Workflow**: Escalate incidents to counselors or admins when needed.
- **Incident Lifecycle**: Track incidents across Draft → Published → Resolved stages.
- **Teacher Notes**: Document observations privately for deeper context.
- **Student Alerts**: Quick flags like medical, learning, or disciplinary tags visible across modules.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How to write scalable, maintainable frontend code
- Collaborating on production codebases with live users
- Handling real-world edge cases and data validation
- Implementing features that support multi-role environments (Teachers, Students, Admins)
- Building for accessibility (WCAG 2.1 compliance)
